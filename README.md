PICKUP LINE GENERATOR

How Does it Work?
1. Create hash map containing top 500 boys and girls names in the United States
2. Use PRAW to scrape r/Tinder and r/pickuplines based on relevance
3. Query for pickup lines containing names in the created hash map
4. Store fitting lines in MongoDB database using pymongo
5. Create frontend using ReactJS
6. Create backend using express.js, node.js
7. Connect frontend and backend to create pickup line generator
